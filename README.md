[DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) (dynamic adaptive
streaming over HTTP), also called MPEG-DASH, is a technology used for media streaming over the web,
commonly used for video on demand (VOD) and “replay/catch-up TV” services. The Media Presentation
Description (MPD) is an XML document that lists the resources (manifest or “playlist”) forming a
streaming service. A DASH client uses the manifest to determine which assets to request in order to
perform adaptive streaming of the content. DASH MPD manifests can be used with content using
different codecs (including H264, HEVC, AV1, AAC, VP9, MP4A, MP3) and containers (MP4, WebM,
Matroska, AVI). There is a good explanation of adaptive bitrate video streaming at
[howvideo.works](https://howvideo.works/#dash).

This commandline application allows you to **download streaming video** or audio to your local
device. This involves selecting the alternative with the most appropriate encoding (in terms of
bitrate, codec, etc.), fetching segments of the content using HTTP or HTTPS requests and muxing
audio and video segments together. There is also support for downloading subtitles (mostly WebVTT,
TTML, SRT, tx3g and SMIL formats, with some support for wvtt format).

This application builds on the [dash-mpd](https://crates.io/crates/dash-mpd) crate. It works for
streaming that uses DASH adaptive streaming (MPD manifests), and doesn’t currently have support for
HLS streaming (m3u8 manifests).

## Features

The following features are supported:

- **Multi-period** content. The media in the different streams will be saved in a single media container
  if the formats are compatible (same resolution, codecs, bitrate and so on) and the
  `--no-period-concatenation` commandline option is not provided, and otherwise in separate media
  containers.

- The application can download content available over HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2. Network bandwidth can
  be throttled (see the `--limit-rate` commandline argument).

- Support for SOCKS and HTTP **proxies**, via the `--proxy` commandline argument. The following
  environment variables can also be used to specify the proxy at a system level: `HTTP_PROXY` or
  `http_proxy` for HTTP connections, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy` for HTTPS connections, and
  `ALL_PROXY` or `all_proxy` for all connection types. The system proxy can be disabled using the
  `--no-proxy` commandline argument.

- Support for HTTP Basic **authentication** (see the `--auth-username` and `--auth-password` commandline
  arguments) and for Bearer authentation (see the `--auth-bearer` commandline argument). This
  authentication information is sent both to the server which hosts the DASH manifest, and to the
  server that hosts the media segments (the latter often being a CDN).

- **Subtitles**: download support for WebVTT, TTML, SRT, tx3g and SMIL streams, as well as some support
  for the wvtt format. We support both subtitles published as a complete file and segmented
  subtitles made available in media fragments.

- The application can read **cookies** from the Firefox, Chromium, Chrome, ChromeBeta, Safari and
  Edge browsers on Linux, Windows and MacOS, thanks to the
  [bench_scraper](https://crates.io/crates/bench_scraper) crate. See the `--cookies-from-browser`
  commandline argument. Browsers that support multiple profiles will have all their profiles scraped
  for cookies.

- Support for **decrypting** media streams that use ContentProtection (DRM 🗝️). This requires either the
  `mp4decrypt` or `shaka-packager` commandline application to be installed. mp4decrypt is available
  from the [Bento4 suite](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/) ([binaries are
  available](https://www.bento4.com/downloads/) for common platforms), and [shaka-packager
  binaries](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager) are available from Google for common
  platforms (see the Releases section on their GitHub page). See the `--key` commandline argument to
  specify a decryption key (can be used several times if different keys are used for different media
  streams). See the `--decryption-application` commandline argument to specify which decryption
  application to use. Shaka packager is able to decrypt more types of media streams (including in
  particular WebM containers and more encryption formats), whereas mp4decrypt mostly works with MPEG
  Common Encryption.

- Support for selecting the streams to download based on audio language, quality, horizontal and
  vertical resolution of the video stream, and role annotation (e.g. `main` instead of `alternate`
  role).

- Support for **[rewriting the MPD
  manifest](https://emarsden.github.io/dash-mpd-cli/rewriting.html)** before downloading, for
  example to replace the URL of certain segments by other URLs, or to drop certain Periods based on
  different criteria (such as the CDN or DAI server they originate from, the content language). The
  rewriting instructions are specified by a user-supplied XSLT stylesheet, which is applied to the
  XML of the MPD manifest (see the `--xslt-stylesheet` commandline argument). A convenience form for
  dropping elements based on an XPath specification is also provided (see the `--drop-elements`
  commandline argument). This functionality depends on the xsltproc commandline tool.

- XLink elements (only with actuate=onLoad semantics), including resolve-to-zero.

- All forms of segment index info: SegmentBase@indexRange, SegmentTimeline,
  SegmentTemplate@duration, SegmentTemplate@index, SegmentList.

- Media containers of types supported by mkvmerge, ffmpeg, VLC or MP4Box (this includes ISO-BMFF /
  CMAF / MP4, Matroska, WebM, MPEG-2 TS, AVI), and all the codecs supported by these applications.

- Any video resolution available on the streaming server, including 1080p and 4K content.

- In practice, all features used by real streaming services and on-demand TV. Our test suite
  includes test streams published by industry groups such as HbbTV and the DASH Industry Forum, and
  comprises a wide variety of DASH streams using different publishing software, including GPAC (used
  by Netflix and other services), Amazon MediaTailor, Google’s Shaka packager, Microsoft’s Azure
  Media Services, and Unified Streaming. Test content is served by different CDNs including Akamai
  and various telecom providers.

The following are not currently supported:

- **Live streams** (dynamic MPD manifests), that are used for live streaming/OTT TV are not really
  supported. This is because we don’t implement the clock-related throttling that is needed to only
  download media segments when they become available. However, some media sources publish
  “pseudo-live” streams where all media segments are in fact available; they simply don’t update the
  manifest once the live is complete. We are able to download these streams using the
  `--enable-live-streams` commandline argument. You might also have some success with a live stream
  in combination with the `--sleep-requests` commandline argument. The VLC application is a better
  choice for watching live streams.

- XLink elements with actuate=onRequest semantics.

- HLS streaming (m3u8 manifests).

- Microsoft Smooth Streaming



## Run safely in a Docker container

The application, alongside the external helper applications that it uses for muxing media streams,
for extracting/converting subtitle streams, and for decrypting content infected with DRM, are
available as a prebuilt container, which is probably the easiest and safest way to run it. The
container is packaged with a minimal Alpine Linux installation and can be run on any host that can
run Linux containers (using [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on
Linux, Microsoft Windows and MacOS). It’s available in the GitHub Container Registry `ghcr.io`.

> [!TIP]
> What are the **advantages of running in a container**, instead of natively on your machine?
>
> - Much safer, because the container isn't able to modify your host machine, except for writing
>   downloaded media to the directory you specify. This is a very good idea when running random
>   software you downloaded from the internet!
>
> - No need to install the various helper applications (ffmpeg, mkvmerge, mp4decrypt,
>   shaka-packager, MP4Box, xsltproc), which are already present in the container.
>
> - Automatically run the latest version of dash-mpd-cli and the various helper applications (the
>   container runtime will pull the latest version for you automatically).
>
> - Podman and Docker also allow you to set various limits on the resources allocated to the
>   container (number of CPUs, memory); see their respective documentation.

Unlike running software in a virtual machine, there is only a negligeable performance penalty to
running in a container. That’s not quite true: if you’re running the container on an aarch64 (“Apple
Silicon”) Mac, Podman will set up a virtual machine for you. On Windows, Podman will set up a
low-overhead WSL2 virtual machine for you.

I recommend installing [Podman](https://podman.io/) because it’s fully free software, whereas Docker
is partly commercial. Podman is also able to run containers “rootless”, without special privileges,
which is good for security.

To **run the container** with podman:

    podman machine start (optional step, only required on Windows and MacOS)
    podman run --rm -v .:/content ghcr.io/emarsden/dash-mpd-cli -v <MPD-URL> -o foo.mp4

On the first run, this will fetch the container image (around 220 MB) from the GitHub Container
Registry ghcr.io, and will save it on your local disk for later uses. You can later delete the image
if you no longer need it using `podman image rm` and the image id shown by `podman images` (see the
[user manual](https://emarsden.github.io/dash-mpd-cli/container.html) for details).

📁 Your current working directory (`.`) will be mounted in the container as `/content`, which will be
the working directory in the container. This means that an output file specified without a root
directory, such as `foo.mp4`, will be saved to your current working directory on the host machine.

On Linux/AMD64, it’s also possible to run the container using the [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/)
container runtime runsc, which uses a sandbox to further improve security (strong isolation, protection
against privilege escalation). This requires installation of runsc and running as root (runsc
doesn’t currently support rootless operation).

    sudo apt install runsc
    sudo podman --runtime=runsc run --rm -v .:/content ghcr.io/emarsden/dash-mpd-cli -v <MPD-URL> -o foo.mp4

The container image is a **multiarch** manifest, currently built for the following platforms:

- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64
- linux/armv7 (should run on a Raspberry Pi)
- linux/riscv64
- linux/ppc64le


## Installation

If you prefer to install the software and its dependencies on your computer in the traditional way,
you can download a prebuilt binary or build from source yourself.

**Binary releases** are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/emarsden/dash-mpd-cli/releases) for
GNU/Linux on AMD64 (statically linked against Musl Libc to avoid glibc versioning problems),
Microsoft Windows on AMD64 and MacOS on aarch64 (“Apple Silicon”). These are built
automatically on the GitHub continuous integration infrastructure.

On macOS and Linux, you can install the software using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew install dash-mpd-cli
```

You can also **build from source** using an [installed Rust development
environment](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

```shell
cargo install dash-mpd-cli
```

This installs the binary to your installation root’s `bin` directory, which is typically
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`.

You should also install the following **dependencies**:

- the mkvmerge commandline utility from the [MkvToolnix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) suite, if you
  download to the Matroska container format (`.mkv` filename extension). mkvmerge is used as a
  subprocess for muxing (combining) audio and video streams. See the `--mkvmerge-location`
  commandline argument if it’s not installed in a standard location (not on your PATH).

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) or [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to download to the MP4
  container format, also for muxing audio and video streams (see the `--ffmpeg-location` and
  `--vlc-location` commandline arguments if these are installed in non-standard locations). See the
  `--muxer-preference` commandline argument to specify which muxing application to prefer for
  different container types.

- the MP4Box commandline utility from the [GPAC](https://gpac.wp.imt.fr/) project, if you want to
  test the preliminary support for retrieving subtitles in wvtt format. If it's installed, MP4Box
  will be used to convert the wvtt stream to the more widely recognized SRT format. MP4Box can also
  be used for muxing audio and video streams to an MP4 container, as a fallback if ffmpeg and vlc
  are not available. See the `--mp4box-location` commandline argument if this is installed in a
  non-standard location.

- the mp4decrypt commandline application from the [Bento4
  suite](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/), if you need to fetch encrypted content.
  [Binaries are available](https://www.bento4.com/downloads/) for common platforms. See the
  `--mp4decrypt-location` commandline argument if this is installed in a non-standard location.

- for some types of streams that the mp4decrypt application is not able to decrypt (for example
  content in WebM containers), you should install the [Shaka packager
  application](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager) developed by Google. See the
  `--decryption-application` commandline option to specify the choice of decryption application, and
  the `--shaka-packager-location` commandline argument if it is installed in a non-standard location.

- the xsltproc commandline utility packaged with libxslt, which is used for the MPD rewriting
  functionality (the `--drop-elements` and `--xslt-stylesheet` commandline options).

This crate is tested on the following **platforms**:

- Our prebuilt container images are tested using Podman on Linux and Windows

- Linux on AMD64 (x86-64) and Aarch64 architectures

- MacOS on AMD64 and Aarch64 (“Apple Silicon”) architectures

- Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11 on AMD64

- Android 12 on Aarch64 via [termux](https://termux.dev/) (you’ll need to install the rust, binutils
  and ffmpeg packages, and optionally the mkvtoolnix, vlc and gpac packages). You’ll need to disable
  the `cookies` feature by building with `--no-default-features`.

- FreeBSD/AMD64 and OpenBSD/AMD64. You’ll need to disable the `cookies` feature. Some of the
  external applications we depend on (e.g. mp4decrypt, Shaka packager) are poorly supported on OpenBSD.



## Usage

See the 📖 [user manual](https://emarsden.github.io/dash-mpd-cli/usage.html).



## Muxing

The underlying library `dash-mpd-rs` has two methods for muxing audio and video streams together. If
the library feature `libav` is enabled (which is not the default configuration), muxing support is
provided by ffmpeg’s libav library, via the `ac_ffmpeg` crate. Otherwise, muxing is implemented by
calling an external muxer, mkvmerge (from the [MkvToolnix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) suite),
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or
[MP4Box](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/wiki/MP4Box) as a subprocess. Note that these commandline
applications implement a number of checks and workarounds to fix invalid input streams that tend to
exist in the wild. Some of these workarounds are implemented here when using libav as a library, but
not all of them, so download support tends to be more robust with the default configuration (using
an external application as a subprocess). The `libav` feature currently only works on Linux.

The choice of external muxer depends on the filename extension of the path supplied to `--output`
or `-o` (which will be `.mp4` if you don't specify the output path explicitly):

- `.mkv`: call mkvmerge first, then if that fails call ffmpeg, then try MP4Box
- `.mp4`: call ffmpeg first, then if that fails call vlc, then try MP4Box
- `.webm`: call vlc, then if that fails ffmpeg
- other: try ffmpeg, which supports many container formats, then try MP4Box

You can specify a different order of preference for muxing applications using the
`--muxer-preference` commandline option. For example, `--muxer-preference avi:vlc,ffmpeg` means that
for an AVI media container the external muxer vlc will be tried first, then ffmpeg in case of
failure. This commandline option can be used multiple times to specify options for different
container types.



## Similar tools

Similar commandline tools that are able to download content from a DASH manifest:

- `yt-dlp <MPD-URL>`

- `N_m3u8DL-RE <MPD-URL>`

- `streamlink -o /tmp/output.mp4 <MPD-URL> worst`

- `ffmpeg -i <MPD-URL> -vcodec copy /tmp/output.mp4`

- `vlc <MPD-URL>`

- `gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=<MPD-URL>`

However, dash-mpd-cli (this application) is able to download content from certain streams that do
not work with other applications:

- streams using xHE-AAC codecs are currently unsupported by ffmpeg, streamlink, VLC, and gstreamer
- streams in multi-period manifests
- streams using XLink elements


## Building

```
$ sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
$ git clone https://github.com/emarsden/dash-mpd-cli
$ cd dash-mpd-cli
$ cargo build --release
$ target/release/dash-mpd-cli --help
```

The application can also be built statically with the musl-libc target on Linux. First install the
[MUSL C standard library](https://musl.libc.org/) on your system. Add linux-musl as a target to your
Rust toolchain, then rebuild for the relevant target:

```
$ sudo apt install musl-dev
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Static musl-libc builds don’t work with OpenSSL, which is why we disable default features on the
dash-mpd crate and build it with [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) support (a Rust TLS
stack). You may encounter some situations where rustls fails to connect (handshake errors, for
example) but other applications on your system can connect. These differences in behaviour are
typically due to different configurations for the set of root certificates. If you prefer to use
your machine’s native TLS stack, replace both instances of `rustls-tls` by `native-tls` in
`Cargo.toml` and rebuild.


## Why?

The [dash-mpd-rs](https://github.com/emarsden/dash-mpd-rs) library at the core of this application
was developed to allow the author to watch a news programme produced by a public media broadcaster
whilst at the gym. The programme is published as a DASH stream on the broadcaster’s “replay”
service, but network service at the gym is sometimes poor. First world problems!
